A Brakey's Jam Game

This Game Idea was You Have 2 Players And You Can Controll Only One For A Certain Amount Of Time
The Closer The Players Was, The More Damage You Could Do.

What's unfinished

- Can't stop moving when colliding with wall
- No More Than 1 Level
- No Other Enemy's And Game Stuff
- No Level Selection
- You Can't Hit The Enemies

What Needs Improvement
- Player's Movement
- How Enemy's Move
- The Visuals
- The Code
